## Objective
In this challenge, we practice calculating the probability of a compound event. We recommend you review today's [Probability Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-1/tutorial) before attempting this challenge.

## Task
There are $3$ urns labeled $X$, $Y$, and $Z$.
- Urn $X$ contains $4$ red balls and $3$ black balls.
- Urn $Y$ contains $5$ red balls and $4$ black balls.
- Urn $Z$ contains $4$ red balls and $4$ black balls.

One ball is drawn from each of the $3$ urns. What is the probability that, of the $3$ balls drawn, $2$ are red and $1$ is black?
